# Wall-dancing

A Unity game based on the Hole in the Wall show

This game was created as the final project of the course Bioinspired Complex Systems at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.

The user is standing in front of the camera of his device, and the program will classify him into different positions using a neural network trained by our data.

The goal of the game is to not fall down from a platform, while walls with different shapes of holes are coming towards the player. For this the user will need to move in front of the camera to the different positions, so it will fit trough the wall.

The game is gradually getting harder, because the walls are coming faster at each turn.

This game inspires people to physical activity while also having fun.
